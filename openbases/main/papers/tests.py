# Validation functions for openbases papers.

# The format of this file is based on levels, messages, and functions.
# It is intended to be run against a single yml file loaded as json. The
# intention is to make it easy to write and understand these criteria. The
# format is the following:

# SECTION DEFINITIONS
# - the version of the criteria format is under version
# - checks: is the group that is run for validation
# - the first field under checks is for a group of checks. You can name it
#   whatever is appropriate for your need (e.g., titles)
# - name: corresponds to the name of the subsection (a check)
# - function: is the python module --> function that is run
# - level: is the python logger level to emit.
# - the subsuections underneath are also different named (individual) checks
# - args: should be a list of named (or not named) arguments.

# It's helpful to look at the example below and then reference the above!

# WRITING FUNCTIONS

# Each function should have the first variable be the file being checked, or
# the loaded specification as a json-derivative (python dictionary). If 
# running from the command line, you would need to provide the path to this
# criteria and the file. If you want to save the redundant loads, you can run
# the validations from within python (and provide the data structure as 
# variable.

# Each of the checks (the functions that you write and provide) should return
# True (passed) or False (failed). You can print output to help the user to
# your heart's content.
