  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Reproducibility is the hallmark of good science.
                 Maintaining a high degree of transparency in scientific
                 reporting is essential not just for gaining trust and
                 credibility within the scientific community but also for
                 facilitating the development of new ideas. Sharing data and
                 computer code associated with publications is becoming
                 increasingly common, motivated partly in response to data
                 deposition requirements from journals and mandates from
                 funders. Despite this increase in transparency, it is still
                 difficult to reproduce or build upon the findings of most
                 scientific publications without access to a more complete
                 workflow. FINDINGS: Version control systems (VCS), which have
                 long been used to maintain code repositories in the software
                 industry, are now finding new applications in science. One
                 such open source VCS, Git, provides a lightweight yet robust
                 framework that is ideal for managing the full suite of
                 research outputs such as datasets, statistical code, figures,
                 lab notes, and manuscripts. For individual researchers, Git
                 provides a powerful way to track and compare versions, retrace
                 errors, explore new approaches in a structured manner, while
                 maintaining a full audit trail. For larger collaborative
                 efforts, Git and Git hosting services make it possible for
                 everyone to work asynchronously and merge their contributions
                 at any time, all the while maintaining a complete authorship
                 trail. In this paper I provide an overview of Git along with
                 use-cases that highlight how this tool can be leveraged to
                 make science more reproducible and transparent, foster new
                 collaborations, and support novel uses.",

               psychology research is hindered by lack of a coordinated effort
               to develop and deploy standardized paradigms. While several
               frameworks (de Leeuw (2015); McDonnell et al. (2012); Mason and
               Suri (2011); Lange et al. (2015)) have provided infrastructure
               and methods for individual research groups to develop paradigms,
               missing is a coordinated effort to develop paradigms linked with
               a system to easily deploy them. This disorganization leads to
               redundancy in development, divergent implementations of
               conceptually identical tasks, disorganized and error-prone code
               lacking documentation, and difficulty in replication. The
               ongoing reproducibility crisis in psychology and neuroscience
               research (Baker (2015); Open Science Collaboration (2015))
               highlights the urgency of this challenge: reproducible research
               in behavioral psychology is conditional on deployment of
               equivalent experiments. A large, accessible repository of
               experiments for researchers to develop collaboratively is most
               efficiently accomplished through an open source framework. Here
               we present the Experiment Factory, an open source framework for
               the development and deployment of web-based experiments. The
               modular infrastructure includes experiments, virtual machines
               for local or cloud deployment, and an application to drive these
               components and provide developers with functions and tools for
               further extension. We release this infrastructure with a
               deployment (http://www.expfactory.org) that researchers are
               currently using to run a set of over 80 standardized web-based
               experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk. By providing open source
               tools for both deployment and development, this novel
               infrastructure holds promise to bring reproducibility to the
               administration of experiments, and accelerate scientific
               progress by providing a shared community resource of

                 registry which can be used to distribute bioinformatic
                 software as Docker images. However, its lack of curation and
                 its genericity make it difﬁcult for a bioinformatics user to
                 ﬁnd the most appropriate images needed. BioShaDock is a
                 bioinformatics-focused Docker registry, which provides a local
                 and fully controlled environment to build and publish
                 bioinformatic software as portable Docker images. It provides
                 a number of improvements over the base Docker registry on
                 authentication and permissions management, that enable its
                 integration in existing bioinformatic infrastructures such as
                 computing platforms. The metadata associated with the
                 registered images are domain-centric, including for instance
                 concepts deﬁned in the EDAM ontology, a shared and structured
                 vocabulary of commonly used terms in bioinformatics. The

                 discovery, as well as a link to the tool description in the
                 ELIXIR registry if it already exists. If it does not, the
                 BioShaDock registry will synchronize with the registry to
                 create a new description in the Elixir registry, based on the
                 BioShaDock entry metadata. This link will help users get more
                 information on the tool such as its EDAM operations, input and

                   aspects of scientific research, computational
                   reproducibility has become an issue of increasing importance
                   to computer systems researchers and domain scientists alike.
                   Though computational reproducibility seems more straight
                   forward than replicating physical experiments, the complex
                   and rapidly changing nature of computer environments makes
                   being able to reproduce and extend such work a serious
                   challenge. In this paper, I explore common reasons that code

                   current approaches to these issues, including virtual
                   machines and workflow systems, and their limitations. I then
                   examine how the popular emerging technology Docker combines
                   several areas from systems research - such as operating
                   system virtualization, cross-platform portability, modular

  abstract  = "It is commonly agreed that in silico scientific experiments
               should be executable and repeatable processes. Most of the
               current approaches for computational experiment conservation and
               reproducibility have focused so far on two of the main
               components of the experiment, namely, data and method. In this
               paper, we propose a new approach that addresses the third
               cornerstone of experimental reproducibility: the equipment. This
               work focuses on the equipment of a computational experiment,
               that is, the set of software and hardware components that are
               involved in the execution of a scientific workflow. In order to
               demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal, we describe a use
               case scenario on the Text Analytics domain and the application
               of our approach to it. From the original workflow, we document
               its execution environment, by means of a set of semantic models
               and a catalogue of resources, and generate an equivalent
               infrastructure for reexecuting it.",

                   tools for scientific data management (SDM) designed to
                   support scientific transparency and reproducible research.
                   SDM has been in active use at our MRI Center for more than
                   two years. We designed the system to be used from the
                   beginning of a research project, which contrasts with
                   conventional end-state databases that accept data as a
                   project concludes. A number of benefits accrue from using
                   scientific data management tools early and throughout the
                   project, including data integrity as well as reuse of the
                   data and of computational methods.",
