This code is licensed under the Affero GPL, version 3.0 or later [LICENSE](LICENSE).</p>
<p>The Affero GPL is a Copyleft license, meaning that it aims to ensure
that free and open software remains perpetually free and open by requiring
users of it to license their improvements under the same terms as the original.</p>
<p>If you make changes to the software and make the modified software available
to users within your organization (for example, students at a university)
via a network, this is considered propogation (not conveyance) and you
do not need to share your modifications. if you transfer copies of the
software to others, this <strong>is</strong> considered a conveyance.</p>
<p># Contributing
When contributing to Singularity Python Client, it is important to properly communicate the
gist of the contribution. If it is a simple code or editorial fix, simply
explaining this within the GitHub Pull Request (PR) will suffice. But if this
is a larger fix or Enhancement, it should be first discussed with the project
leader or developers.</p>
<p>Please note we have a code of conduct, described below. Please follow it in
all your interactions with the project members and users.</p>
<p>## Pull Request Process</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Send PRs to the master branch for merge as a pypi release, or development
if the intention is to add to next pypi release.</li>
<li>Follow the existing code style precedent. This does not need to be strictly
defined as there are many thousands of lines of examples. Note the lack
of tabs anywhere in the project, parentheses and spacing, documentation
style, source code layout, variable scoping, and follow the project’s
standards.</li>
<li>Test your PR locally, and provide the steps necessary to test for the
reviewers.</li>
<li>The project’s default copyright and header have been included in any new
source files.</li>
<li>All (major) changes to Singularity Python Client must be documented in
[docs](docs). If your PR changes a core functionality, please
include clear description of the changes in your PR so that the docs
can be updated, or better, submit another PR to update the docs directly.</li>
<li>If necessary, update the README.md.</li>
<li>The pull request will be reviewed by others, and the final merge must be
done by the project lead, &#64;vsoch (or approved by her).</li>
</ol>
<p># Code of Conduct</p>
<p>## Our Pledge</p>
<p>In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.</p>
<p>## Our Standards</p>
<p>Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Using welcoming and inclusive language</li>
<li>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences</li>
<li>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism</li>
<li>Focusing on what is best for the community</li>
<li>Showing empathy towards other community members</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances</li>
<li>Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks</li>
<li>Public or private harassment</li>
<li>Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic
address, without explicit permission</li>
<li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
professional setting</li>
</ul>
<p>### Our Responsibilities</p>
<p>Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.</p>
<p>Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.</p>
<p>## Scope</p>
<p>This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.</p>
<p>## Enforcement</p>
<p>Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project leader (&#64;vsoch). All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response
that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project
team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of
an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted
separately.</p>
<p>Project maintainers, contributors and users who do not follow or enforce the
Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions
with their involvement in the project as determined by the project’s leader(s).</p>
